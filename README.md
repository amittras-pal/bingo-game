# BINGO App - Built on MERN!

This is a digital version of the classic game called **BINGO**. The players aim to complete a specific pattern on their board of 25 blocks, and win the game. The numbers they select on the board must have been called by the conductor. The basic rules that this game follows can be found [Here](https://www.atlanticbingosupply.com/about/howto-play-bingo "Atlantic Bingo Supply!")
